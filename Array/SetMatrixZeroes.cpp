/*
Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in place.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given a matrix

[
  [1,2],
  [0,3]
],
return
[
[0,2],
[0,0]
]

Challenge 
Did you use extra space?
A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution?

class Solution {
public:
    /*
     * @param matrix: A lsit of lists of integers
     * @return: 
     */
    void setZeroes(vector<vector<int>> &matrix) {
        // write your code here
    }
};
