/*
Suppose you have a system, the input is an dynamic integer data stream. 
Suppose the data stream contains duplicate value. Find the kth largest elements
in the data stream and return the index. If the duplicate values exist in 
multiple index, return them all.
Eg: The data stream is 4,2,2,3,1, k is 4, the answer is 2. The index is 1,2.
The data steam is 1,2,3,4,5, k is 3, the answer is 3 and the index is 2.
