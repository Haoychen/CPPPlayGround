/*
Given points and relationship matrices , determine if they make valid relations

Where points could be a,b,c ...
relationship is : direction: North, East, South, West

a N b: a is north to b
b S a: b is South to a

This is valid relation.
But a N b, b N a. Not valid.

There could be n # of points. First he asked me wether there are any other
violation that I can see. After A WHILE I figured for 3 also it could be problem.
Then he asked: do u have to check for 2, 3 points, and like that how many
points I should be checking.
At the end: how can I write algorithm to do so.

Not such a good interview experience (that hour) .. I couldn't figured out, and he didn't give any hint either. I still need to figure out solution for that.
